Chem Ed 12/11 Update:


revisions directory:
- revised_x.csv  : this file is used modeling.R, already cleaned
- x_model.csv    : this 'raw' file is used by preprocess.R

Paper 1
- use the updated dataset that VW sent out
	- 1170 row for MUST vs course average
- remove born in texas variable
- merge the UNT schools
- question categories?

changes:
- merged the UNT schools
- omitted the rows with no course average value reported
- class variable: "PB" value
- omitted the hrs variable (all previous models showed no significance)
- omitted tx_hs variable (1030 yes, 72 no), too 'yes' saturated
- omitted emp_on, emp_off (heavily saturated with no's)


Paper 2
- use the updated dataset that VW sent out
	- 1036 row for MUST vs common question
- revisit calculations that Kirk set, get back to Kirk


To-Do List:

1. clean MUST data so that it looks EXACTLY like x_model.csv so that we can clean it with the same code in preprocess.R
2. remove born in texas variable
3. combine the UNT schools
4. repeat the modeling done in modeling.R
---------------------------------------------------------------
5. revisit paper 2 calculations
