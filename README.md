Data Analysis for TAMU Chemistry Department

paper_1: We explored the role of MUST exam score along with other demographic
         features for students in various schools in Texas in performance in 
         university level Chemistry courses. In particular, we model students'
         course percentage using their numeric score from the MUST exam. 
         In addition to the course average, we were also interested in 
         students' success/failure in the Chem I class. We used a linear 
         regression model with the complete set of features, and then used 
         LASSO regression for variable selection. 

paper_2: With the added Common Question (CQ) variable (12 questions), we 
         explore further relationships between CQ and MUST performance, CQ 
         and university level Chemistry course performance, among other 
         academic-related metrics.
