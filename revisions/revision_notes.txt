## Directory contents:
(1) Address the points in the reviewer comments about old vs new MUST


Notes: 
- use the dataset intended for SECOND paper since the data is more processed (?)
	- makes sense to use one centralized dataset for analysis so that we need
	  not distinguish which dataset we're using, allows for consistency

# Columns used in dataset before we make changes to adapt it to account for
# new vs. old MUST (35 columns)
	# school   
	# course   
	# class    
	# gender   
	# ethnic   
	# major    
	# tx_birth
	# tx_hs  
	# emp_on

- Questions 6, 16, 17, 18 are the new questions that were added to MUST

General Approach:
(1) comparing old vs. new
    - course average using old must
    - course average using new must

(2) categorizing must questions to identify types of questions that are 
    indicative of course performance

    # categories:
        # (1) mult    : 1, 2, 3               (multiplication questions)
        # (2) div     : 4, 6, 7, 8, 16        (division questions)
        # (3) frac    : 9, 10, 17, 18         (fraction questions)
        # (4) log_exp : 5, 12, 13, 14, 15     (logs and power questions)
        # (5) chem    : 11, 19, 20            (chemistry questions)

	- use MUST detail to create question categories 
	    - form category scores (sum over category scores to recover MUST)


Other things to consider:
    - if we want to focus on the impact of MUST as a performance indicator, 
      we might want to consider modeling without the demographic features and 
      treating each MUST question as a separate indicator feature. this would
      make modeling less convoluted when we are trying to compare old/new must


Models:

Regression
    (1)  course avg ~ new/old must total (omit category sums)
         (a) course avg ~ old must + ...
         (b) course avg ~ new must + ...
    (2)  course avg ~ new/old must individual questions (omit category sums)
         (a) course avg ~ 16 old MUST questions + ...
         (b) course avg ~ 20 MUST questions + ...
    (3)  course avg ~ category sums (omit old_sum, must totals)
    (4)  course avg ~ 20 individual must questions (LASSO for var selection)
    (5)  course avg ~ category sums (LASSO for var selection)


Classification
    (6)  pass ~ new/old mst total (omit category sums)
         (a) pass ~ old must + ...
         (b) pass ~ new must + ...
    (7)  pass ~ new/old must individual questions (omit category sums)
         (a) pass ~ 16 old MUST questions + ...
         (b) pass ~ 20 MUST questions + ...
    (8)  pass ~ category sums (omit old_sum, must totals)
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TBD if we want to include these models:
    (9)  pass ~ 20 individual must questions (LASSO for var selection)
    (10) pass ~ category sums (LASSO for var selection)


1.9.19
- remove variable created from merging grandparent, parent education (too messy)
    - blank entries encoded as DK
- emp_on, emp_off: blank entries encoded as N (corrected obvious typos to valid input)
-
