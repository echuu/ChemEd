## Directory contents:
(1) Address the points in the reviewer comments about old vs new MUST


Notes: 
- use the dataset intended for SECOND paper since the data is more processed (?)
	- makes sense to use one centralized dataset for analysis so that we need
	  not distinguish which dataset we're using, allows for consistency

# Columns used in dataset before we make changes to adapt it to account for
# new vs. old MUST (35 columns)
	# school   
	# course   
	# class    
	# gender   
	# ethnic   
	# major    
	# tx_birth
	# tx_hs  
	# emp_on   
	# emp_off  
	# hrs      
	# version  
	# MQ1 : MQ20     
	# must     
	# pass     
	# gp_edu  


General Approach:
(1) comparing old vs. new
    - course average using old must
    - course average using new must

(2) categorizing must questions to identify types of questions that are 
    indicative of course performance
	- use MUST detail to create question categories 
	    - form category scores (sum over category scores to recover MUST)
