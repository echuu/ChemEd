    data                       contains all data files

        MUST_data.csv          Raw data
        model_x.csv            Cleaned data, contains response variable, 13 predictors


    MUST_script.R              Read in raw data from MUST_data.csv, reproduce figures and
                               and tables as shown in the paper. This file needs to be 
                               run first.
  
    preprocess.R               Preprocess the variables to make values comprehensible.
                               Creates the model_x.csv data

    train.R                    Create the train/test split using model_x.csv

    evaluateClassification.R   Contains functions to evaluate classification accuracy:
                               classAccuracy(), tuneThreshold()

    model.R                    Model the data using train.csv, test.csv
    

In order to run the model.R file, you must first:
    1. run MUST_script.R to define some global variables
    2. run train.R, which contains the generateTrainTest() function
    3. run evaluateClassification.R which contains classAccuracy(), tuneThreshold()
    4. set working directory to location of model.R
